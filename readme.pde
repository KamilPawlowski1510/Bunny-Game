Brief description of the animation achieved:
You can walk around as a bunny. You can move in all 4 cardinal directions, change your speed and interact with a sword.

Known bugs/problems:
Attempting to combine any of the movement keys (WASD) results in only one being acted on. It end ups feeling unnatural and clunky.
